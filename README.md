# Rajagopal_Grid_Estimation
The following github repository is meant to include Matlab programs to reproduce and extend results of grid topology estimation using the Chow-Liu algorithm for different mutual information computational techniques. The programs are meant to extend and speed up computation experiments made in the NAPS paper by Yizheng and Dr. Weng <http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/7335248/>
