# Rajagopal_Grid_Estimation
The following github repository is meant to include Matlab programs to reproduce and extend results of grid topology estimation using the Chow-Liu algorithm for different mutual information computational techniques. The programs are meant to extend and speed up computation experiments made in the NAPS paper by Dr. Liao, Dr. Weng and Prof. Rajagopal found in the following link <http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/7335248/>.
