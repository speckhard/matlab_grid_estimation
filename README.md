# Rajagopal_Grid_Estimation

Author: Daniel Speckhard

E-mail: DTS@stanford.edu, speckharddt@gmail.com

Sumamry: The following github repository is meant to include Matlab programs to reproduce and extend results of grid topology estimation using the Chow-Liu algorithm for different mutual information computational techniques. The programs are meant to extend and speed up computation experiments made in the NAPS paper by Dr. Liao, Dr. Weng and Prof. Rajagopal found in the following link <http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/7335248/>. 

Description of sub-folders:

The 'experimental' folder contains programs that have been run to test new computational techniques and modelling. 

The 'production' folder contains program that are meant to be shared and used by groups outside of the Rajagopal group.

The 'gif_files' folder contains gif files created for different data-sets to help visualize how the algorithm performs on different data-sets.

The 'plotting_scripts' folder contains scripts to plot data from different data-sets, sampling techniques, mutual information estimation techniques, etc...
